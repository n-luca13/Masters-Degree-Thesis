**Design of a Multimodal Interaction for Text Editing on Android**
- March 16, 2023

- In the last two months of my academic career, I designed and developed an android app based on a **multimodal interaction** to facilitate **text editing** on mobile, trying to avoid that tedious process of careful cursor positioning and exact text selection.
- The project has been focused on **UX design**, applying principles and methods of *human-centered design* and *design thinking*, but an **android app prototype** was ultimately developed to evaluate the proposed solution.
